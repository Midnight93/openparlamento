openparlamento
==============

This github project contains the source code of the Open Parlamento project.

The project is considered by openpolis *legacy software*; it'sbased on the php framework symfony (v1.0) 
and currently there is no intention of porting it into a later and more modern symfony release,
or another web technology alltogether.

Maintenance activities will nevertheless continue.
